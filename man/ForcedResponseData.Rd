\title{Randomized Response Survey of a simulated population}
\format{A data frame containing 1000 observations from a population of \eqn{N=10000}. The variables are:
\itemize{
 \item ID: Survey ID
 \item z: The randomized response
 \item Pi: first-order inclusion probabilities
}}
\usage{
ForcedResponseData
}
\description{
This data set contains observations from a randomized response survey obtained from a simulated population.
The main variable is a binomial distribution with a probability 0.5.
The sample is drawn by simple random sampling without replacement.
The randomized response technique used is the Forced Response model (Boruch, 1972) with parameters \eqn{p_1=0.2} and \eqn{p_2=0.2}.
