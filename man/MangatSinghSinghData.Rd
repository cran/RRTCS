\title{Randomized Response Survey on internet betting}
\format{A data frame containing 802 observations from a population of students divided into eight strata. Each strata has a certain number of clusters, totalling 23.
The variables are:
\itemize{
    \item ID: Survey ID of student respondent
    \item ST: Strata ID
    \item CL: Cluster ID
    \item z: The randomized response to the question: In the last year, did you bet on internet?
    \item Pi: first-order inclusion probabilities

\description{
This data set contains observations from a randomized response survey conducted in a university to investigate internet betting.
The sample is drawn by stratified (by faculty) cluster (by group) sampling.
The randomized response technique used is the Mangat-Singh-Singh model (Mangat, Singh and Singh, 1992) with parameter \eqn{p=0.6}.
The unrelated question is: Does your identity card end in an even number? with a probability \eqn{\alpha=0.5}.
