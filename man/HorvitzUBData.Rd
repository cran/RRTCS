\title{Randomized Response Survey on drugs use}
\format{A data frame containing a sample of 188 observations from a population of \eqn{N=802} students divided into four cluster.
The variables are:
\itemize{
 \item ID: Survey ID of student respondent
 \item CL: Cluster ID
 \item I: The first randomized response to the question: Have you ever used drugs?
 \item J: The second randomized response to the question: Have you ever used drugs?
 \item Pi: first-order inclusion probabilities
}}
\usage{
HorvitzUBData
}
\description{
This data set contains observations from a randomized response survey conducted in a university to investigate drugs use.
The sample is drawn by cluster sampling with the probabilities proportional to the size.
The randomized response technique used is the Horvitz-UB model (Chaudhuri, 2011) with parameters \eqn{p_1=0.6} and \eqn{p_2=0.7}.
