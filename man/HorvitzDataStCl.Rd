\title{Randomized Response Survey on infidelity}
\format{A data frame containing 365 observations from a population of \eqn{N=1500} students divided into two strata. The first strata has 14 cluster and the second has 11 cluster.
The variables are:
\itemize{
    \item ID: Survey ID of student respondent
    \item ST: Strata ID
    \item CL: Cluster ID
    \item z: The randomized response to the question: Have you ever been unfaithful?
    \item Pi: first-order inclusion probabilities
  }}
\usage{
HorvitzDataStCl
}
\description{
This data set contains observations from a randomized response survey conducted in a university to investigate the infidelity.
The sample is drawn by stratified (by faculty) cluster (by group) sampling.
The randomized response technique used is the Horvitz model (Horvitz et al., 1967) with parameter \eqn{p=0.6}.
The unrelated question is: Does your identity card end in an odd number? with a probability \eqn{\alpha=0.5}.
