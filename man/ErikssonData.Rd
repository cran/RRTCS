\title{Randomized Response Survey on student cheating}
\format{A data frame containing 102 students of a sample extracted from a population of \eqn{N=53376} divided into four strata.
The variables are:
\itemize{
    \item ID: Survey ID of student respondent
    \item ST: Strata ID
    \item z: The randomized response to the question: How many times have you cheated in an exam in the past year?
    \item Pi: first-order inclusion probabilities
}}
\usage{
ErikssonData
}
\description{
This data set contains observations from a randomized response survey conducted in a university to investigate cheating behaviour in exams.
The sample is drawn by stratified sampling by university faculty with uniform allocation.
The randomized response technique used is the Eriksson model (Eriksson, 1973) with parameter \eqn{p=0.5} and \eqn{S} a discrete uniform variable at the points (0,1,3,5,8).

The data were used by Arcos et al. (2015).
