\value{
Point and confidence estimates of the sensitive characteristics using the Diana-Perri-1 model. The transformed variable is also reported, if required.
}
\description{
Computes the randomized response estimation, its variance estimation and its confidence interval through the Diana-Perri-1 model.
The function can also return the transformed variable.
The Diana-Perri-1 model was proposed by Diana and Perri (2010, page 1877).
}
\details{
In the Diana-Perri-1 model let \eqn{p\in [0,1]} be a design parameter, controlled by the experimenter, which is used to randomize the response as follows: with probability
\eqn{p} the interviewer responds with the true value of the sensitive variable, whereas with probability \eqn{1-p} the respondent gives a coded value,
\eqn{z_i=W(y_i+U)} where \eqn{W,U} are scramble variables whose distribution is assumed to be known.

To estimate \eqn{\bar{Y}} a sample of respondents is selected according to simple random sampling with replacement.
The transformed variable is
\deqn{r_i=\frac{z_i-(1-p)\mu_W\mu_U}{p+(1-p)\mu_W}}
where \eqn{\mu_W,\mu_U} are the means of \eqn{W,U} scramble variables, respectively.

The estimated variance in this model is
\deqn{\widehat{V}(\widehat{\bar{Y}}_R)=\frac{s_z^2}{n(p+(1-p)\mu_W)^2}}
where \eqn{s_z^2=\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{(z_i-\bar{z})^2}{n-1}}.

If the sample is selected by simple random sampling without replacement, the estimated variance is
\deqn{\widehat{V}(\widehat{\bar{Y}}_R)=\frac{s_z^2}{n(p+(1-p)\mu_W)^2}\left(1-\frac{n}{N}\right)}
