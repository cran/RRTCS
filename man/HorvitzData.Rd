The variables are:
\itemize{
 \item ID: Survey ID of student respondent
 \item z: The randomized response to the question: Have you been bullied?
 \item Pi: first-order inclusion probabilities

\description{
This data set contains observations from a randomized response survey conducted in a university to investigate bullying.
The sample is drawn by simple random sampling without replacement.
The randomized response technique used is the Horvitz model (Horvitz et al., 1967 and Greenberg et al., 1969) with parameter \eqn{p=0.5}.
The unrelated question is: Were you born between the 1st and 20th of the month? with \eqn{\alpha=0.6666667}.
