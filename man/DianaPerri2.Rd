\value{
Point and confidence estimates of the sensitive characteristics using the Diana-Perri-2 model. The transformed variable is also reported, if required.
}
\description{
Computes the randomized response estimation, its variance estimation and its confidence interval through the Diana-Perri-2 model.
The function can also return the transformed variable.
The Diana-Perri-2 model was proposed by Diana and Perri (2010, page 1879).
}
\details{
In the Diana-Perri-2 model, each respondent is asked to report the scrambled response \eqn{z_i=W(\beta U+(1-\beta)y_i)} where \eqn{\beta \in [0,1)} is a suitable constant
controlled by the researcher and \eqn{W,U} are scramble variables whose distribution is assumed to be known.

To estimate \eqn{\bar{Y}} a sample of respondents is selected according to simple random sampling with replacement.
The transformed variable is
\deqn{r_i=\frac{z_i-\beta\mu_W\mu_U}{(1-\beta)\mu_W}}
where \eqn{\mu_W,\mu_U} are the means of \eqn{W,U} scramble variables, respectively.

The estimated variance in this model is
\deqn{\widehat{V}(\widehat{\bar{Y}}_R)=\frac{s_z^2}{n(1-\beta)^2\mu_W^2}}
where \eqn{s_z^2=\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{(z_i-\bar{z})^2}{n-1}}.

If the sample is selected by simple random sampling without replacement, the estimated variance is
\deqn{\widehat{V}(\widehat{\bar{Y}}_R)=\frac{s_z^2}{n(1-\beta)^2\mu_W^2}\left(1-\frac{n}{N}\right)}
